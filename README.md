# Face-Expression-Recognition-using-Texture-Features-in-Python
Diploma project
Software application in Python, allowing to preprocess face images (from JAFFE database), for precise face localization, extract LBP-based texture descriptors, set different parameters and integrate the descriptors in a multi-class SVM classification scheme for expression recognition. The user will have the possibility to select: the training dataset; images to be analyzed; different parameters associated to the feature extraction and classification.
